# Where the Wind Goes

Where the Wind Goes is a wind-powered endless scroller where you play as a beetle tangled in a spiderweb, navigating through nature’s obstacles. Using gusts of wind, you’ll rotate sticks that serve as bridges to guide your path, all while avoiding the dangers of the web and drifting through a serene yet perilous landscape.
